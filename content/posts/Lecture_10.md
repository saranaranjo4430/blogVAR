# Homework: The Shape of Smartphones
Smartphones have undergone significant shape transformations since their introduction. Early models were bulky with physical keyboards (e.g., BlackBerry), gradually evolving into sleeker, touchscreen-based devices that maximize screen size while minimizing bezels, influenced by user demand for larger displays and more immersive media consumption.

Key changes were driven by:
- **User Needs:** A desire for more screen real estate for video, gaming, and multitasking.
- **Technological Advancements:** Better display technologies (e.g., OLED) and more compact components allowed for thinner devices.
- **Durability:** The inclusion of materials like Gorilla Glass and aluminum helped in reducing fragility.
- **Portability and Usability:** Foldable and flexible displays have emerged, aiming to blend large displays with portability.

#### Future Transformations:
The next step in smartphone evolution may likely involve **fully foldable or rollable displays** and **wearable technology**. Devices that blend smartphones with smartwatches or even glasses may become mainstream, eliminating the need to carry a traditional handheld device. The move towards **ambient computing**—where the interface becomes more integrated into everyday surroundings—could also influence smartphone form factors, creating devices that are even more immersive, ergonomic, and seamlessly integrated into daily life.

I believe foldable and flexible screens will dominate because they provide both the large screen experience and compactness, addressing the ongoing demand for portability without sacrificing display size.
