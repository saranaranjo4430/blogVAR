Hereâ€™s how I created my **first Unity project** â€“ a simple game called *Roll-a-Ball* â€“ and the steps I followed to bring it to life!

---

### Step 1: Setting Up Unity ðŸŽ®
- **Download Unity Hub** from [here](https://unity.com/download).
- Install Unity Editor through Unity Hub.
- Create a new 3D project and name it whatever you like. I called mine *Roll-a-Ball*.

### Step 2: Follow the Tutorial
You can follow the official *Roll-a-Ball* tutorial on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), but hereâ€™s what I did!

### Project Breakdown:

#### **Unityâ€™s Prefab System:**
I used **Prefabs** to reuse GameObjects (GOs). Hereâ€™s how:
- **Drag the GameObject** from the Hierarchy into the `Assets/Prefabs` folder.
- The GO turns blue, meaning itâ€™s now a Prefab!

#### **Creating Collectibles (PickUps):**
I created **PickUps** (green for points, orange for penalties). Then I added some animation using this simple code for oscillation:
```csharp
float t = (Mathf.Sin(Time.time * speed * Mathf.PI * 2.0f) + 1.0f) / 2.0f;
```

#### **Adding Rotation and Oscillation:**
I used the **Lerp function** to interpolate between two points, giving the PickUps a rotating and oscillating effect, which made the game feel dynamic.

#### **Player Controller and Collisions:**
I modified the `PlayerController.cs` script to detect collisions using Unity's **colliders**. When the player hits a **green** object, they score +1; when they hit **orange**, they lose 1 point.

Make sure to set **"Is Trigger"** in the inspector and use **rigidbody components** on PickUps.

#### **UI for the Score:**
To display the score, I added a **UI text element** with TextMeshPro. You can find it under **Hierarchy > UI > Text-TextMeshPro** and drag it into the PlayerController script to keep track of the playerâ€™s score.

### Step 3: Testing the Game
Once everything was set, I hit the play button and tested the mechanics to make sure the score, rotation, and collisions worked as expected.

Now you have a basic game in Unity! You can follow along with the full tutorial [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), but this is a great foundation to start creating your own projects.
