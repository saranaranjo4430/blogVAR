# Homework: Use the Prototype for Evaluation
Ask a friend to test your **Smart Fridge Organizer** prototype. Have them go through the process of "scanning" a grocery item (using sticky notes) and receiving a recipe suggestion. Observe how they interact with the prototype. Do they understand the process? Is the interaction intuitive? Ask them what improvements they suggest and reflect on the feedback. Did the user experience friction in any part of the flow? Were there any suggestions for making the app more user-friendly?

By testing the prototype, youâ€™ll gain valuable insights into how real users perceive your concept.
