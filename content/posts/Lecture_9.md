# Homework: Use the Prototype for Evaluation
I decided to test my **Smart Fridge Organizer app** concept with a friend. I showed him my paper prototype, which included hand-drawn sketches of the app's interface and features like the QR code integration, expiration date alerts, and recipe suggestions based on the items in your fridge and counter.

#### User Feedback:
My friend found the concept very practical, especially the ability to scan the QR code from the supermarket to upload purchases automatically. He appreciated that this feature avoids the hassle of manually inputting every item, which he found tedious in other food tracking apps. Additionally, the expiration date alerts were seen as helpful for reducing food waste, a concern for him as he often forgets when items are close to expiring.

However, he pointed out that some people might not use the app if it requires too many steps initially (such as scanning a QR code or searching for products manually). He suggested integrating the app with supermarket loyalty cards to automatically sync purchases without needing to scan anything.

#### Critical Reflection:
Based on this feedback, I realized that user experience must prioritize minimal effort, especially for busy individuals. The QR code system simplifies input significantly, but further integration with existing supermarket systems could make the app even more seamless. A future improvement could be exploring partnerships with grocery stores for automatic data syncing, ensuring that users don't need to remember to scan a QR code.

Overall, the concept seems to meet user needs for easy food management, but further iteration is necessary to streamline the onboarding process.
