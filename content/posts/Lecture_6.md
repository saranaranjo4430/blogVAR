# Summary and key concepts of the lecture 
**Prototyping** plays a key role in refining and testing design concepts before full-scale implementation. It involves creating simplified versions of a system, which range from low-fidelity prototypes like paper sketches and storyboards to high-fidelity prototypes that closely simulate the final product, such as interactive wireframes or functional hardware prototypes.

### Prototyping helps to:
- Explore design ideas quickly.
- Test functionality and usability with real users.

**Evaluation** is critical to ensure the prototypes meet user needs. It includes usability testing, where users interact with the prototype while researchers collect data on its effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Evaluation methods can be both quantitative (e.g., measuring task completion times) and qualitative (e.g., gathering user feedback).

A combination of **A/B testing**, **heuristic evaluations**, and **user feedback** ensures that the final design aligns with user expectations, improving both the functionality and user experience of the system.

**First prototypes** should be made quickly (ideally within one day) to facilitate rapid iteration.

### Dependent and Independent Variables (in an experiment):
- **Dependent variable**: The variable you measure (e.g., the bounce height of a ball).
- **Independent variable**: The variable you control or set (e.g., the height from which the ball is dropped).
- **Control variable:** The constant in the experiment that does not change (e.g., the type of ball, its material, and size).

Example experiment:** Dropping a ball from various heights and measuring the bounce height.

### Example experiment: 
Dropping a ball from various heights and measuring the bounce height.
- **Dependent variable:** the bounce of the ball
- **Independent variable:** the height at which I drop the ball
- **Control variable:** the ball itself (it's dimensions, it's materials)
