First prototypoes should be made fast (in within 1 day)




Dependent and independent variables (in an experiment):
Dependent : what you mesure 
Independent : what you set in an experiment
control variable : the one that you use to verify, that doesn't change

Example of experiment : I drop a ball form certain heights and I mesure the bounce 
Dependent variable : the bounce of the ball
Independent variable : the height at which I drop the ball
Control variable : the ball itself (it's dimensions, it's materials)
