# Key concepts:
**Prototyping** plays a key role in refining and testing design concepts before full-scale implementation. It involves creating simplified versions of a system, which range from low-fidelity prototypes like paper sketches and storyboards to high-fidelity prototypes that closely simulate the final product, such as interactive wireframes or functional hardware prototypes.

### Prototyping helps to:
- Explore design ideas quickly.
- Test functionality and usability with real users.

**Evaluation** is critical to ensure the prototypes meet user needs. It includes usability testing, where users interact with the prototype while researchers collect data on its effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Evaluation methods can be both quantitative (e.g., measuring task completion times) and qualitative (e.g., gathering user feedback).

A combination of **A/B testing**, **heuristic evaluations**, and **user feedback** ensures that the final design aligns with user expectations, improving both the functionality and user experience of the system.

**First prototypes** should be made quickly (ideally within one day) to facilitate rapid iteration.

### Dependent and Independent Variables:
- **Dependent variable**: The variable you measure.
- **Independent variable**: The variable you control or set.
- **Control variable:** The constant in the experiment that does not change.

{{< notice example >}}
Dropping a ball from various heights and measuring the bounce height.
- **Dependent variable:** the bounce of the ball
- **Independent variable:** the height at which I drop the ball
- **Control variable:** the ball itself (it's dimensions, it's materials)

# Input Devices and Interaction Paradigms

#### Input Device: **Google Glass**
{{< figure src="/blogVAR/images/google_glass.jpg" alt="Google Glass" caption="Google Glass" >}}
**User Interface Type**: Wearable User Interface (WUI) and Augmented Reality (AR)

**Overview**: Google Glass was an AR wearable launched in 2013, featuring a head-mounted display that provided hands-free access to information and services. Users interacted via voice commands, touch gestures on the frame, and head movements. The device projected information onto a small screen in the userâ€™s field of vision.

**Reasons for Failure**:
- **Privacy Concerns**: The ability to record discreetly raised ethical issues.
- **Price**: The high cost ($1500) limited consumer adoption.
- **Limited Functionality**: The device lacked compelling use cases for everyday users and suffered from battery issues.
  
Despite its failure in the consumer market, Google Glass succeeded in industrial and medical applications, where privacy and cost concerns were outweighed by its utility in providing hands-free information.

**Future Potential**: While it failed as a mass-market product, the core AR and wearable technology behind Google Glass could still succeed with better privacy safeguards and more affordable, advanced versions for specific industries. With the increasing focus on AR and IoT, refined iterations could see success in the future.
