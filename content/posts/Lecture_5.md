## An example of a design process 
Task of creating an online platform (doctolib) :
How to aproach it : 
- make sure that it is secure 
- strict policy of the information given to the doctor and to the patient
- create a "data base" of the doctors that want to participate 
- ask people what they want to do for the platform and what do they want to see on it 
- start from a base, for example doctolib and then add functinalities on top of it. Identity the problems that people (doctors and patients) have with doctolib. And then built on top of it. It's always easier to start from something. 
-  Maybe ask yourself what are the problems with the platform, do a survey, ... 

## Difference between UCD (User Centered Desing) and HCD (Human Centered Design)

UCD : focus on the user itself, not taking into acount other factors. (just focusing on the patients and the doctors, and not on the people that are going to run the app, hospital people, environmental factors, side effects, ...)

Keep a camera and try to understand what are the issues the user encounters, to then try to improve them. 
If the users know that they are being observed they are going to have some bias, they might change what they are doing. 

HCD :  Takes into account the human aspect. Takes into account everything as a system. And do an iterative work. 

Usability : Effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction (the attitute through the application)

To calculate the effectiveness : (formula)
And time-based efficciency : (formula)

# Qualitative vs Quantitative : 
Quantitative research : focus on testing theories and their hypothesis, a lot of statistics and maths. Collect a very large number of samples. Objective and you can replicate the results. 
Qualitative research : You ask open-ended questions, you don't need a lot of participants. You can pick a small number of participants and analyse their responses. Subjective.

Which research method for HCI ? A mix of both.
