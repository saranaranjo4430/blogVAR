# Summary and key concepts of the lecture 

Summary of Lecture: Design Processes – Prototyping and Evaluation
This lecture focuses on the **design process** in Human-Centered Design (HCD), emphasizing the importance of user involvement, prototyping, and evaluation to create systems that are both usable and useful. The design process follows a structured, iterative approach, incorporating user feedback and addressing their needs at every stage.

## Key Concepts:
### 1. Human-Centered Design (HCD):
- HCD is an approach that prioritizes the needs, behaviors, and requirements of people involved in the system, not just end-users but all stakeholders, including designers, developers, and even those who maintain the system.
- It involves applying human factors, ergonomics, and usability principles to ensure systems are usable and user-friendly.
### 2. User-Centered Design (UCD):
- UCD is a subset of HCD, focusing on the end-user's experience. It involves understanding the user's context, defining requirements, designing solutions, and evaluating them through constant iteration.
- The **four phases** of UCD include:
    - **Phase 1:** Understand the Context of Use – Gathering data through interviews, focus groups, and observations to define user needs.
    - **Phase 2:** Requirements – Defining the problems and goals based on user research to address pain points through wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
    - **Phase 3:** Design – Iteratively creating and refining designs based on feedback from stakeholders.
    - **Phase 4:** Evaluation – Testing the design with real users to identify usability issues using methods like usability testing, A/B testing, and heuristic evaluation.
### 3. Prototyping:
- Prototyping is an essential part of the design process that involves creating preliminary models of the product to test and refine.
- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes:** Paper prototypes, wireframes, sketches, or storyboards that help test basic functionality and gather feedback early in the design process.
- **High-Fidelity Prototypes:** Digital prototypes or hardware models that closely resemble the final product. These are used for in-depth testing and refining the design based on real user interactions.
### 4. Types of Prototypes:
- **Horizontal Prototyping:** Covers multiple features but lacks depth in functionality. Suitable for exploring a wide range of features.
- **Vertical Prototyping:** Focuses deeply on a few features, often as proof of concept, to explore complex functions.
### 5. Evaluation Methods:
- **Usability Testing:** Involves real users performing tasks to assess ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction.
- **A/B Testing:** Compares two variations of a design to see which performs better in terms of user behavior or engagement.
- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Experts review the design against usability principles to identify potential issues before testing with real users.
### 6. Research Methods:
- **Qualitative Methods:** Such as interviews, observations, and focus groups that explore user behavior and preferences in depth.
- **Quantitative Methods:** Such as surveys or lab studies that provide measurable data to compare different versions of a design.
### 7. Design Process Application:
- The lecture also touched on how to design a system from scratch using an example task: creating a **doctor-patient consultation platform**. The process involved gathering user needs through ethnography, focus groups, and interviews, followed by creating personas and scenarios, and then building and testing prototypes.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the **design process** is iterative, with constant user involvement to refine and improve a system. By focusing on human-centered approaches, designers can ensure that their products are not only functional but also meet the emotional, cultural, and practical needs of their users.

The video titled "It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere" discusses the concept of "Norman Doors," which are doors designed so poorly that people struggle to figure out whether to push or pull them. The speaker emphasizes the importance of intuitive design, using doors as an example of how bad design can create frustration. The video explores how simple cues, like handles or labels, can either help or hinder user interaction, stressing the need for user-friendly design across all products.

## An example of a design process 
### Task: Creating an Online Platform (similar to Doctolib)
#### Approach:
1. **Ensure Security:**
- Prioritize the security of the platform, especially regarding sensitive data. Implement strong encryption and follow strict privacy protocols to protect both doctor and patient information.
2. **Establish Clear Information Policies:**
- Define strict guidelines on what information is accessible to doctors and patients. Ensure that the flow of information complies with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
3. **Create a Doctor Database:**
- Build a comprehensive database of doctors who wish to participate in the platform, ensuring their credentials and availability are properly verified.
4. **Gather User Requirements:**
- Conduct user research to understand the needs and expectations of both doctors and patients. This could be done through surveys, interviews, or focus groups.
5. **Start with an Existing Platform:**
- Use an existing platform like Doctolib as a starting point. Identify the pain points and limitations that doctors and patients experience with the current platform. From there, add functionalities that address these issues.
6. **Identify Problems and Build Solutions:**
- Conduct surveys or interviews to find out what problems users encounter on the platform. Use these insights to improve the user experience by refining and adding features based on real needs.
This process ensures that the platform is both user-centered and built on top of an existing foundation, reducing development time and improving user satisfaction.
